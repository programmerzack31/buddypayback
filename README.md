## About BuddyPay

BuddyPay is a secure and user-friendly peer-to-peer digital payment platform designed to make transferring money between users as seamless and intuitive as possible. With a clean interface and efficient functionality, BuddyPay allows users to send and receive funds using UPI IDs in real time. The system validates recipient details, ensures transaction authentication with password verification, and logs every transfer for transparency and reference.

BuddyPay also includes features such as in-app notifications, transaction history, and a responsive interface suitable for both desktop and mobile environments. The platform is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), ensuring scalability, performance, and maintainability.

Security is a top priorityâ€”passwords are never stored in plain text, authentication tokens are securely handled, and environment variables are protected during deployment. By combining reliability, security, and ease of use, BuddyPay aims to offer a dependable digital wallet experience for modern users.
